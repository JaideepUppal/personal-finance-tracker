# 💰 Personal Expense Tracker (Frontend Practice)

This project is a **basic expense tracker web app** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** only.  
It demonstrates my current understanding of **frontend development fundamentals** — layout design, DOM manipulation, and data persistence using `localStorage`.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This is _not_ the final version of my **Personal Finance Tracker**.  
> It’s a **work-in-progress (WIP)** project meant to showcase my progress in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before I build the full application.  
> Stay tuned — the final, more advanced project will be released soon on my GitHub profile!

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Download or clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/personal-expense-tracker.git
   ```
2. Inside the project folder, manually create two subfolders:
   a. css
   b. js
4. Open the folder in VS Code or your file explorer.
5. Launch any of the HTML files directly (e.g., dashboard.html) or use Live Server in VS Code for a smoother experience.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project helped me practice:
Structuring multi-page websites without frameworks
Reusing one CSS file across multiple pages
Using modals for CRUD operations
Working with browser storage (localStorage)
Organizing JavaScript code into separate modules/files

## 📅 Work in Progress

I’m currently working on the final version, which will include:
A proper backend (probably with Laravel Blade + Herd + Mysql database)
More detailed analytics and charts
User authentication
A cleaner responsive design
